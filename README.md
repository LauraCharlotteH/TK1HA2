	// TODO test if the (x,y) stuff is correct... else we will have loads of array.outOfBounds
	// TODO try at least(0,0) and (maxheight, maxwidth)
	// TODO test if my connection from view to servers works as it should
	// TODO make ant file that sets everything up and starts the stuff including servers etc so that the
